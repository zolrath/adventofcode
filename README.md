# Advent of Code

It's that time of year again!  

With the sights, smells and sounds of holiday cheer bubbling all around us there's nothing
that gets me in the season quite like locking myself up in a dark room and participating
in programming challenges.

## But in Python this time.

In past years I've done Advent of Code in Go and in Elixir, this time I'll be trying my hand at
Python as it's susinct and Jupyter Notebooks are fun.

- [Advent of Code Helpers](https://github.com/zolrath/adventofcode/blob/master/AoC_Helpers.ipynb): A mixture of functions stolen from [Peter Norvig](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Advent%20of%20Code.ipynb)
as well as my own which cover many common tasks used in Advent of Code challenges.

- [Advent of Code 2015](https://github.com/zolrath/adventofcode/blob/master/AoC_2015.ipynb): I did a number of 2015 challenges to warm up over the weekend.

- [Advent of Code 2016](https://github.com/zolrath/adventofcode/blob/master/AoC_2016.ipynb): I only completed a few 2016 challenges in Python.

- [Advent of Code Warmup](https://github.com/zolrath/adventofcode/blob/master/AoC_Warmup.ipynb): An unoffical entry but in the days prior to AoC 2017 a warmup challenge was put on
the internets and to sate my intense desire to make ASCII art light up I completed it

- **[Advent of Code 2017](https://github.com/zolrath/adventofcode/blob/master/AoC_2017.ipynb): We're here now!**
