    "## [Warmup 1](https://pastebin.com/raw/BMd61PUv): Elvish Cheat Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the run up to advent, the elves are playing on their video game console. Before long, one of the elves manages to discover a cheat mode, by entering a sequence of button presses on the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence involves the buttons 'Up', 'Down', 'Left', 'Right', 'A', 'B', and terminates with a single press of the 'Start' button.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elves begin to ponder the significance of the sequence they discovered, and decide to draw a chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting at the origin in an (x,y) grid, the buttons Up, Down, Left, Right are imagined to move a cursor a single step in the corresponding direction through the grid. Buttons A and B place corresponding markers at the current cursor location.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "**Example**:  Up, A, Right, Right, B, Left, B, Start\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking Right to be the positive x direction, and Up to be the positive y direction. This sequence will move one step up from the origin (0,0), and place an 'A' marker at location (0,1), then a 'B' marker at location (2,1). The cursor will move one step left and another 'B' marker is placed at location (1,1). Then the cursor halts at location (1,1).\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "**Example**:  Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, starting from the origin (0,0), this sequence will place both a 'B' and an 'A' marker at (0,0), and the cursor will halt at (0,0).\n",
